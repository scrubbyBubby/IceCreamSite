# Ice Cream Site

### Site Link
<https://scrubbybubby.github.io/IceCreamSite>

### Overview
This site is a conversion of the former site of a local Ice Cream Parlor I once lived by. Development focused on utility the component structure of AngularJS, while optimizing visuals for both desktop and mobile.

### Stack
I'm using pure AngularJS for this site, with Gulp as a CSS preprocessor to allow for better segmentation of the CSS files.

### Goals
This site was my first project I intended to include in a portfolio. I focued primarily on demonstrating my ability to study the documentation and write efficiently in a proper JavaScript framework. A highlight of the site is the toppings menu, which is an interactable table that will show toppings by category, or combination of categories, animating the topping titles into position each time. The site also allows users to choose from one of 4 ice-cream-colored themes, that is remembered upon further visits, as well as Google polls to advertise new items or enable customer interaction.
